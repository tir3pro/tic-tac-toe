The application is coded on React, ES6 and uses a webpack as a task-manager. In order to use new features as ES6 and others installed loaders which compile your piece of code into the compatible one in all browsers e.g. Babel loader, and tools which make your work faster and more productive as Hot loader.

I use React because when I started doing the task, I’d just completed the React course, so it was a great chance to check knowledge I got. It seems that I know this library better than others now. In fact, the app is just a view which renders different states.

When you open a project, you will see three folders: **public, rules and src**
**public** folder: folder for the client with **index.html** file where React puts the App;
**rules** folder:	
	index.js file uses a node.js method to create **rules.json** file before running the App to know the board size and winner lines;
	winGenerator.js – function which generates all possible winner lines;
	when App is run, there will be **rules.json** file generated by the method from **rules/index.js**;
**src** folder, folder to work with: 
	**components** folder: there are all React components: Square for rendering a simple square, BoardRow for rendering one row in Board, Board for rendering the Board and the main component Game which sets App state and logic;
	helpers folder: calculateWinner.js file with a function which checks whether somebody wins or not;
	index.jsx – file which renders the App into the DOM.
	styles.scss – the App styles
Files **package.json** and **webpack.config.js** are the files with info, dependencies and settings needed for the project.
