It's a simple **Tic-tac-toe** game.

In order to run the project install modules using the command ```npm install``` and when it's completed, run ```npm start``` or npm run start-unix in your command line.

If you want to change the board size, go to the [package.json](https://github.com/tir3pro/tic-tac-toe/blob/master/package.json) file, use the variable **BOARD_SIZE** and task board size. Look at a ```start```-task as an example.
